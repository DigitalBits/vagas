# DigitalBits is growing
## Grow with us!

Our project grows rapidly, and we constantly challenge ourselves, there is always an opportunity to be better. We strive to raise the level of our products, our teams and ourselves

We look for engaged professionals, people who stand out and make the difference. If you identify with our values come to be part of the team

## Our Values

- **Sweat the Details**<br/>
We dive deep into the details to find the root cause. When problems are unclear or ambiguous, we ask why and keep digging to find the answer. We use data and facts to inform what is needed and most valuable. We succeed when we solve problems, not when we ship.

- **Own It**<br/>
DigitalBits's problems are our problems and we are independent, resourceful, and responsible problem solvers. We take ownership and work diligently to drive solutions across the finish line – we never back down and we are not easily blocked.

- **World Class**<br/>
We Have Ambitious Standards!<br/>
 The path to world class is never ending. We determine our objectives and goals by setting our sights high, so we constantly challenge ourselves and strive to raise the level of our products, our teams and ourselves.

- **We Are Curious & Humble**<br/>
We’re open minded and we like to discuss and debate thoughts, ideas and plans to broaden and further inform our beliefs and approaches. We know that ego prevents us from learning. We seek, accept and give feedback fearlessly to continue to grow personally and professionally.

- **Autonomy, Trust and Freedom**<br/>
We try to trust people to get sh*t done. Speed matters. We take calculated risks to move quickly and are willing to be wrong so that we can learn the right solution. Our model is to increase the freedom of people as we grow, so we continue to attract and nurture innovative people, increasing the chance for sustainable success.

- **Awesome professionals**<br/>
Imagine if every person on the team is someone you respect and learn from.
Incredible workplace is not espresso coffee, lush benefits, sushi at lunch, big parties or beautiful offices. We do some of these things, but only if they are effective in attracting and retaining awesome professionals.
